## Project Proposal for SODV3203: Group 6

### Project Team

- Andre Albuquerque
- Andrew Miller
- Jesse Harasym-Conrod

### Proposal Idea

Our proposal is to create an Android App that can look for properties available for rent in a city. The name of the app will be Rent A Ton.

A user will be able to select from a few cities to search for properties. From there, the app takes the user to a second screen where a map of the city is shown. This will be done using the API from Google Maps. The map then shows some properties available. You can click on a property on the map to view its name and the option to view its details.

After clicking on the details button, the user is taken into a third screen where images of the property can be seen and also specifics of the property as well, like rent price and number for rooms, for example.

### Pogram Features

- Select a city to search for properties
- Look at a map (Google API) of the city with all of the properties available showing.
- Look at pictures and details about the properties
- Ability for potential tenants to "message" the landlord to inquire about a property.
